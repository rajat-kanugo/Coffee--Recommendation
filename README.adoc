# Favorite Coffee â€” Coffee Recommendation with Neo4j

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- JDK 16
- Maven
- Docker

### Starting a Fresh Neo4j Instance

To start a fresh Neo4j instance, run the following command:

```bash
./run-graph-db.sh
You can run Cypher queries in your IDE or in the Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7474/browser.

Running the Application in Development Mode
After starting the Neo4j server locally, you can run the application in development mode using Maven:


mvn quarkus:dev
Once the application is running, you can explore the coffee recommendation website at http://localhost:8080/.

Production Setup
Step 1: Create a Free Cloud Instance of Neo4j
You can create an online free cloud instance of Neo4j at https://dev.neo4j.com/aura.

Step 2: Load Cypher Data
After creating the database, load the necessary Cypher data.

Step 3: Update application.properties
Update your application.properties file with the connection details of your Neo4j cloud instance:


quarkus.neo4j.uri=neo4j://xxxxab01.databases.neo4j.io
quarkus.neo4j.encrypted=true
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.username=your-username
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.password=your-password
Note: Use neo4j:// instead of neo4j+s:// due to a Quarkus issue in version 2.1.2.

Step 4: Package the Application
You can package the application and run it in production mode with the following commands:


mvn package
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
